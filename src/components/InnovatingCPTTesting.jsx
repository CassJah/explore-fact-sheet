      <p>
        Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) is a cornerstone of geotechnical
        engineering. It provides vital data for subsurface investigations,
        informing decisions in construction, infrastructure, and environmental
        projects. However, traditional methods face challenges in speed,
        efficiency, and scalability. Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI)—a game
        changer for CPT and in-situ testing.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Innovations in CPT</h2>
      <p>
        High-tech rigs and real-time data acquisition tools have streamlined
        field operations. Yet, analyzing this data efficiently remains a
        bottleneck. AI addresses this challenge by automating data processing,
        predictive modeling, and risk assessment.
