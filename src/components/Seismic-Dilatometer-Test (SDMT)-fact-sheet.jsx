      <p className="overview">
        At Explore Geotechnical, the Seismic Dilatometer Test (SDMT) enhances
        the capabilities of the traditional DMT by integrating seismic sensors.
        This test measures shear wave velocity alongside standard geotechnical
        parameters, offering comprehensive insights into static and dynamic soil
        properties. SDMT is particularly suited for seismic hazard assessments
        and understanding soil behavior in earthquake-prone regions.

                  The SDMT probe is advanced vertically, stopping at depth
                  intervals (typically 0.5m or 1.0m). For each depth, a hammer
                  strikes a beam to generate shear waves, which are recorded by
                  dual receivers in the probe, providing shear wave velocity
                  (Vs) data in real-time.

                <p>
                  <strong>Data Processing:</strong> Vs is calculated as the
                  ratio of the difference in distance between the source and
                  receivers to the wave arrival time. This data yields precise
                  Vs profiles, which are essential for analyzing soil behavior
                  under seismic loading.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If conducting tests in non-penetrable soils, a borehole
                  backfilled with fine gravel allows for Vs testing, maintaining
                  high-quality data across diverse soil types.
